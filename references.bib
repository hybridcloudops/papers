Due to its increasing interest and imprecise definitions, existing research works have tried to characterize DevOps. Nevertheless, little is known about the practitioners’ understandingabout successful paths for DevOps adoption. Therefore, our goal is to detail real scenarios of DevOps adoption, presenting a theory, a model, and a case study. We used classic Grounded Theory to build a theory about 15 scenarios of successful DevOps adoption in companies from different domains and countries. We proposed a model (i.e., a workflow for DevOps adoption) and evaluated it through a case study at a Brazilian Government institution. We used a focus group to collect the company perceptions about DevOps adoption. This paper increments the existing view of DevOps by detailing real scenarios and explaining the role of each category during DevOps adoption. We provide evidence that collaboration is the core DevOps concern, contrasting with an existing wisdom that automation and tooling can be enough to achieve DevOps. Altogether, our results contribute to: generating an adequate understanding of DevOps, from the practitioners’ perspective; and assisting other institutions in the path towards DevOps adoption."

    abstract = "Context: DevOps is considered important in the ability to frequently and reliably update a system in operational state. DevOps presumes cross-functional collaboration and automation between software development and operations. DevOps adoption and implementation in companies is non-trivial due to required changes in technical, organisational and cultural aspects. Objectives: This exploratory study presents detailed descriptions of how DevOps is implemented in practice. The context of our empirical investigation is web application and service development in small and medium sized companies. Method: A multiple-case study was conducted in five different development contexts with successful DevOps implementations since its benefits, such as quick releases and minimum deployment errors, were achieved. Data was mainly collected through interviews with 26 practitioners and observations made at the companies. Data was analysed by first coding each case individually using a set of predefined themes and thereafter perform a cross-case synthesis. Results: Our analysis yielded some of the following results: (i) software development team attaining ownership and responsibility to deploy software changes in production is crucial in DevOps. (ii) toolchain usage and support in deployment pipeline activities accelerates the delivery of software changes, bug fixes and handling of production incidents. (ii) the delivery speed to production is affected by context factors, such as manual approvals by the product owner (iii) steep learning curve for new skills is experienced by both software developers and operations staff, who also have to cope with working under pressure. Conclusion: Our findings contributes to the overall understanding of DevOps concept, practices and its perceived impacts, particularly in small and medium sized companies. We discuss two practical implications of the results."

However, although many providers offer specific tools for HA support, like floating IPs and load balancing, the analysis of downtime at public cloud providers in previous years shows that a combination of several availability zones or cloud providers is required to achieve “five nines” availability. Besides reducing the chances of failure, the use of multiple availability zones and geographically distributed clouds may additionally bring performance and cost benefits. However, the orchestration, in an efficient and adaptive way, of HA multi-tier services in multi-zone and multi-cloud environments brings several challenges. This paper presents a novel orchestration method to automate the deployment and management of high availability multi-tier services on multiple availability zones, by introducing new affinity mechanisms, such as VM to location and role to role affinity/anti-affinity rules. Furthermore, we also extend this solution to multi-cloud scenarios, based on the replication or distribution of the service components among various clouds, along with their corresponding affinity rules."
